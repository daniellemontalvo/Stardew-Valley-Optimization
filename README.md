# Stardew Valley Project

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ This project came from the desire to make the most out of everyday on the Stardew Valley game while playing on my switch during the time I was recovering from surgery.

</aside>

# ðŸ‘€Â Problem

> If you have ever played Stardew Valley, you know that every in the game day lasts 15 minutes. This means that you have 15 minutes to:
> 
- Talk to people in the farm
- Water, plant, or harvest your crops
- Feed your animals and get goods from them
- Buy seeds or any other resources (during business hours)
- Go mining / fishing

Of course, you donâ€™t have to do this every day. But the good thing is that with data, I could optimize the gaming experience by analyzing trends and making the best out of everyday depending on the conditions / luck / and time spent doing each thing.

# ðŸ’­Â Purpose

> I want to create a tool that will provide a list of actions in chronological order to do each day in the game in order to maximize earnings and optimize time spent on different tasks. I want to visualize daily stats to keep in mind while playing and be able to have a purpose when playing.
> 

The main topics I would like to develop my knowledge in are the following:

- Python programming for Data Science
- Interacting with APIs
- Machine Learning & AI
    - Neural Networks
    - Deep Learning
- Using natural language to explain analysis results
- Results Visualization
- Automating prediction processes

---

# ðŸ›«Â Plan

> This project has the potential to be as big as I want to. I am using it as a way to become more proficient in analytics, machine learning and AI, so I will continue developing this project until I find that is time to move to a different topic. But since I love this game and genuinely would love to use data as a guide, I know it will be a very ambitious project.
> 

So far, the tools and analysis that I have in mind to conduct are the following:

- Profit analysis: Have a list of all the possible products in the game, and find which ones lead to the most profitability for each season.
- Gift optimization: Develop a recommendation system for gift-giving based on NPC preferences, relationship levels, and seasonal events.
- Weather Forecasting: Use historical weather data to train a predictive model for forecasting future weather patterns, aiding in crop planning and scheduling activities.
- **NPC Relationship Dynamics**: Analyze interactions and events to understand the dynamics of relationships with NPCs, including factors influencing relationship progression and strategies for efficient relationship-building.
- **Farm Layout Optimization**: Use optimization techniques to design an optimal farm layout, maximizing space utilization and crop yield while considering constraints such as irrigation and proximity to NPCs.
- **Fishing Efficiency Analysis**: Analyze fishing spot data to determine the best times, locations, and bait types for maximizing catch rates and profitability.
- **Energy Management**: Develop strategies for optimizing energy usage throughout the day, balancing tasks like farming, mining, and socializing to maximize productivity.
- **Community Center Bundles Optimization**: Develop a strategy for completing Community Center bundles efficiently, considering item availability, seasonality, and bundle rewards.
- **Task Scheduling**: Develop algorithms for optimizing daily task schedules, considering factors like travel time between locations, task dependencies, and time-sensitive events.
